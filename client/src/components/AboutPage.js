		<h3><b>About this app</b></h3>

		<p>The I Do Swap app, developed as part of the Flat Iron School's
		 part time software engineering final project, is based on a Rails API back end,
		 along with a React/Redux front end.</p>

		<p>This app was inspired by real life events. Going through the process of planning
		 (a paying for) a wedding is one long sticker-shock experience that doesn't end until 
		 the day of the wedding has come and gone.</p>

		<h4><b>Planned features</b></h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Allowing users to sign up/sign ins</li>
			<li>Allowing users to list their own items for sale</li>
			<li>Enabling users to bid on/purchase other's items</li>
		</ul>
