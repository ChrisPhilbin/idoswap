#About I Do Swap

My wife and I recently went through the planning phase of our wedding and soon realized how expensive everything is, and worst of all you only use the decor for maybe 6 hours at most.  I came up with the idea to create a platform that allows couples who are planning a wedding to connect with couples who recently got married to buy and sell wedding decor.  My vision is to have a Craigslist/Ebay hybrid that cators specifically towards wedding decor.

##Methodology

I used Ruby on Rails on the backend to persist objects to the database and React/Redux on the front end to give the UI a modern feel without page refreshes.

Features to be implemented:

- Omniauth using Google

- Payment gateway integration to take care of payments
- Bidding process that entails a starting bid, reserve, time limit, etc.
